They're there when they want, and that's it. From what the info desk girls said, they come by like 4 times a year and it's a craps shoot whether or not you'll be around when they are. Now I have to go to Hollywood to try this place out. Luckily for me, I'll be in Socal next weekend!", "business_id": "KcSJUq1kwO8awZRMS6Q49g", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-05-01", "type": "review"}

What a disappointment!\n\nIt was just a small little stand with one worker who looked like he didn't want to be there!\n\nI ordered a regular hot dog combo, which came with chips, that cost $5.95. The chili dog combo was $6.95. It just tasted like a regular hot dog, except that it had a nice \"snap\" to it (which made me give the place an extra star!). Other than that, nothing special about it. The chili tasted like crap on it, probably because it was old and in the container all day! Ewww! Actually, I bet all the food they served there was old! EKKKK! =O\n\nI had asked the guy working there when they will be opening the actual official stand, and he said he wasn't sure. However, they will be opening one near the Hawaiian Tropic entrance of Planet Hollywood. SOOO..LOOK OUT! Hopefully by that time, the dogs will be better...", "business_id": "KcSJUq1kwO8awZRMS6Q49g", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-11-17", "type": "review"}

If you've been to the original LA location, prepare to be somewhat disappointed. \n\nFood: Meh. The dogs seemed precooked, the buns were plain, and the mushrooms looked canned. The Planet Hollywood dog was damn near $8 alone. I had to ask for a side of nacho cheese, because the PH dog here only comes with a slice of what looked like kraft cheese. The prices were at least $2 more than the LA location, but I guess its understandable since its Las Vegas. The fries weren't freshly prepared like the LA location either. AND to top it off, they didn't have grape Crush soda or Yoo-Hoo like the LA location. \n\nService: The cashier chicks were nice. The dogs and sides were served up\/made in assembly line unlike the personal attention you get from one person at the LA location. \n\nOverall, it was just MEH. I'd rather drive 4 hours, then wait in line for another hour to have an authentic Pink's hotdog. I probably won't come back here unless they somehow manage to replicate everything that the LA location offers. This place seemed like the \"McDonalds\" version of Pink's. The only good thing is that they accept credit cards, while the LA location is only accepts cash.", "business_id": "KcSJUq1kwO8awZRMS6Q49g", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-08-20", "type": "review"}
