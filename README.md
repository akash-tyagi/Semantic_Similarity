Semantic_Similarity
===================

Build a semantic similarity engine using twiitter and google apis based on jaccard and improved similarity function.

for twitter using tweepy
for google using pygoogle.py from xgoogle project

Similarity.py contains two functions 

1.basic_similarity: Using jaccard function

2.improved_similarity: Using fucntion from http://robotics.stanford.edu/users/sahami/papers-dir/www2006.pdf
NOTE: Improved similarity is not working particularly well, somehow not able to fetch the url results from google.
May be need to use the google api
